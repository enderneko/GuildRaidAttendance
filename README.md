## Guide (Admin)

Add a newline for example: **#GRA.Archimonde** or multiple admins **#GRA.Archimonde,Sageras** to **guild information** (no spaces). Require a UI reload.

2. **Import members:** ***Config > Import*** to select your raid members.

4. **Set raid days:** ***Config > Attendance Sheet***, select raid days to show in the attendance sheet.

5. **Set raid start time:** ***Config > Attendance Sheet***, set raid start time for your team members. This time is used to check whether members are late or not. You can also set different times for each day.
